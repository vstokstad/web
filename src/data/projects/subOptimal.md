myWork: "In SubOptimal I was in charge of the whole structure for 'Interactable Objects' and their integration into the game. We both needed a way to highlight those objects in the world, on hovering, and have customizable yet reusable interactions with them. I also did a lot of trial and error with the camera system, first setting out to do an automated system where cameras became active based on player visibility, but as the project progressed we scrapped that for a more robust 'trigger' set-up."

lessons: "While automation is nice, it's sometimes just faster to do it manually from the get go (regarding the camera system). Instead of a heavy inheritance based structure for interactables in the world, it would probably have been both easier and more performant with an interface or component based set-up."
