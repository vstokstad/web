title: "Vulkan engine"

description: "I'm building a vulkan based game engine to learn vulkan, graphics, shaders and ECS. The engine is based on several tutorials, but now I am at a stage where the basics are set up for vulkan, and I can start customizing it further."

teamSize: "Solo project"

projectTime: "Ongoing"

engine: "Vulkan, C++, cross-platform"

role: "Programmer"

myWork: "In this project I'm trying to learn as much as possible. From setting up and managing a vulkan backend to basic gameplay systems, physics and ECS. I'm using some libraries for some parts, and doing others from scratch."

lessons: "Vulkan is a lot of boilerplate, but that also teaches me a lot about how to manage the gpu, memory allocation and timings. It's really fun and not very forgiving. As a whole the project is a pretty good exercise in how to structure projects, abstraction and maintaining an ever-growing codebase."
