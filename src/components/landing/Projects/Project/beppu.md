projectTime: "4 weeks"

engine: "Unreal Engine 4 / C++"

role: "Gameplay- and Systems-programmer"

myWork: "I did a lot of the general gameplay, including AI and interactions/commands as well as designed the systems behind the different commands for the controllable characters. I did the system with designers in mind, resulting in editable blueprints handling the visual ques connected to them."

lessons: "Do level streaming from the start, don't rework the level structure two days before deadline for 'performance'. Buddy coding and closely integrated work between us programmers resulted in a fun AND quite effective workload."
