title: "Bobble Evolution"

description: "School group assignment to do a 3D game based on a 2D classic. In Bubble Evolution you are a little sea creature trying to get to the top of a tower. To your help you have the ability to shoot bubbles, which you can jump onto, dash through and shoot at enemies to capture them. 

I worked on the weapon system AKA Bubble Mechanics, the camera (rotating around the tower, resulting in a 2d game with a 3d aspect, inspired by Fez). I also did a lot of the lighting, sound and managed Perforce, VCS, as well as acted as a unity support person. Made by a team of nine people."
