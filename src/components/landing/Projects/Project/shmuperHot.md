myWork: "Tasked with making a simple space shooter I experimented with time controlled by gameplay, time only moves forward as the player vessel moves around. When porting to iOS i reworked the whole structure of the codebase to make it more performant, implementing a semi data oriented design, where I collectively call update and fixed update on groups of objects instead of running it individually (as is the base implementation in Unity)."

lessons: "Mobile UI is hard to get right. Porting to mobile is less about getting it to run on a small device and more about getting it to feel good on a mobile device."
