teamSize: "9"

projectTime: "6 weeks"

engine: "Unreal Engine 4 / C++"

role: "Lead Programmer, Systems, AI, ''Scan effect'' shader."

myWork: "I constructed the AI system for the 'Entity' as well as the scanning system including the scan shader and
scanned objects custom render depth. I also did a 'pixel sort shader' for a 'distortion-of-reality'-effect when the
player is close to the 'Entity'.As Lead programmer and Perforce/VCS responsible i also worked on several smaller
gameplay things and oversaw the whole version control as well as builds and deployment of the final product."

lessons: "A tighter control on 'interactable Objects' that are supposed to show up on the scanner would have helped a
lot. As most of the puzzles and interactions where almost entirely handled by blueprints in UE4, it would have made it a
lot easier to be a bit more specific in code about which objects should be highlighted and when. Also, the AI turned out more of a trial-and-error test which would have needed a lot more in-game control to be effective in the game."
