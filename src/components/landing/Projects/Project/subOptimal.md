title: "SubOptimal"
description: "SubOptimal is a point and click adventure taking place on a submarine crashed under water.	A mysterious asteroid have crashed closed by and weird energy have transformed the crew of the vessel into strange animal like beings. The player navigates as a hedgehog-rat hybrid through the stranded ship with the goal to repair its vital functions and get it moving again.	I developed the system for 'interactable objects' in the world, which then was connected to a highlight shader and different interactions in the game. In the end almost every object that is not static fell under the interactable object category. And in hindsight the approach i took with an abstract class was probably not the smoothest one.	If i where to redo this part i would most probably go for an interface approach. I also worked a lot on cameras in this game. I tried a system with virtual cameras at fixed positions, with a combination on selecting camera based on player position/line of sight and triggerboxes."
